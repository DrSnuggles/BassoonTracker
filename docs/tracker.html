<h2>What is a tracker?</h2>
A music tracker - or tracker - is type of music sequencer: software to create music by defining a sequence of samples to be played at a certain time with a certain pitch.
<br><br>The name "tracker" comes from "the Ultimate Soundtracker" written by Karsten Obarski and released on the Amiga platform in 1987.<br>
A huge number of other tracker programs followed, steadily improving on the concept, with Protracker as best known example.
After the Amiga they made the jump to the PC, spearheaded by Fasttracker.<br>

Even today the tracker concept is still used in modern music software like <a href="https://www.renoise.com/" target="_blank">Renoise</a> and <a href="http://users.notam02.no/~kjetism/radium/" target="_blank">Radium</a>.

Tracker programs were made by developers for developers: <br>
You don't enter notes on a musical bar, you enter notes by typing hexadecimal numbers in a grid and you apply effects by entering even more numbers.
<br>
<br>Unlike traditional music notation, time is usually represented vertically instead of horizontally, so sequential notes are underneath each other and playback goes from top to bottom.
<br><br>
Multiple number/notes in the same column form a "track", multiple tracks form a "pattern" and multiple patterns form a song.
